# Texture Map Analysis

This file contains an analysis on the texture maps in the game, and which mods
are adding textures to them. The size value is meant to represent the amount of
graphical memory used by the texture and not the file size on your hard drive.
Size is based on the assumption that every pixel is four bytes. This data is
anonymous, and is not automatically submitted to any online service.
